          <p>After my undergraduate studies I decided that Agronomy is not the paath I would love to take. I always felt I would find my feet in the scope of agriculture but my life has always being about technology. I developed an interest for designs, art, photography and nature iteself.<br> Although, I would not say I have everything under control because there are days I would ask myself do you know what youre doing? Have you made the right decision? Is it going to be okay? Can you see what others are doing? Are you sure youre going to make it? The question goes on and on but there is no one else to give the answer but me.</p>
